# Mechanical Engineering Code Repository

This repository contains some code that I implemented throughout engineering school, covering:
- Materials Strength
- Heat Transfer and Thermodynamics
- Power Thermal Systems
- Welding Statistical Analysis

and some other courses.

The primary languages and softwares that I worked with are Python, Matlab, EES (Engineering Equation Solver) and some Arduino code.
