# Mechanical Engineering Code Library
A place to save some code that I implemented throughout engineering school, covering:
- Heat Transfer and Thermodynamics
- Materials Strength
- Welding Statistical Analysis
- Power Thermal Systems
Mainly, the objective is just to store the files ina  repository, that I can revisit anytime in the future.
