# Mechanical Engineering Code Library
This repository contains some code that I implemented throughout engineering school, covering:
- Heat Transfer and Thermodynamics
- Materials Strength
- Welding Statistical Analysis
- Power Thermal Systems

The primary languages and softwares that I worked with are Python, Matlab and EES (Engineering Equation Solver).
Mainly, the objective is just to store the files in a repository, that I can revisit anytime in the future.
